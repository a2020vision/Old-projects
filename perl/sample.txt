Tips for dating a chemE

0. Don't do it.

Seriously. Why would you put yourself throug that? are you more crazy than we are? It isn't worth it! it will probably end badly! Even if <b>you're</b> another chemical engineer, why? (I mean it might not be quite as bad, but since you are one you know how they think and what they do!) You will never see them, you won't understand what they're saying half the time, and... Are you still reading this? Ok fine. I told you I'd give you a list, so let's go on to the next one.

1. Go get your head examined.

If you've stuck with it this far, decided that yes, you truly like this person and that it may be worth it, then... go to a doctor. A psycologist, a neurologist, anything, anyone who will give you a CAT scan or something. Because you may be crazy. <!--add some more here?-->

you're still here? ok then...

2. Tell your friends and family

because you'll need them to get through it sooner or later. if your chemE doesn't have a lot of work now, they might seem like they actually have time and patience for your right now. If your chemE does have lots of work now... they may very well forget they're dating you for a couple days! (I am only half joking about that too).

3. I'll get to numbers 3 through n later.
