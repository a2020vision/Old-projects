<h1 id="chapterTitle">Chapter X "Some Cool Examples" - Part Y, "Matlab Music Madness"</h1>

<!--
This is an example-chapter. It has several purposes:
-to give me a taste of matlab-book-writing
-to show readers my way of approaching and solving a problem in Matlab
-to show off some of Matlab's features
-explaining some ways in which these features can be used.
-->

<p>Before you go on: Turn on your computer's sound; set the volume to something 
moderate, and run the following lines:</p>
<code>load <span color="pink">handel</span><br />
sound(y,Fs);
</code>
<p>What happens? <em>Hallelujah!</em></p>

<p>Matlab has the ability to process, play, and even synthesize sounds. 
The synthesis and processing are really just extensions of Matlab's 
ability to handle (pardon the pun) vectors; the playback and some of the 
synthesis/processing likely come from Matlab's use in dealing with wave 
functions (since, after all, that's really what sound is). Anyway, you're 
not really interested in the history; what you want to know is how to 
use this really cool feature, right?</p>

<h2 id="soundFunction"><code>Sound()</code> Function</h2>
<p>The important part, of course, is the function <code>sound()</code>. As usual, 
I suggest that you go back to your Matlab command prompt, and learn about 
it the same way you've learned about other functions:</p>
<code>
help sound
</code>

<p>And, as usual, this give us all the information we need... as long as 
we already know what we're looking for. Anyway, it tells us that you can 
call <code>sound()</code> like this: <code>sound(y,Fs,bits)</code>. Let 
me break this down a bit for you.</p>
<h3 id="parameters">Parameters</h3>
<p>At the very least, <code>sound()</code> requires one parameter - a vector <code>Y</code>.</p>

<h4 id="y"><code>Y</code></h4>
<p>There are some requirements on <code>Y</code>. It should be a column vector (row 
vectors are known to work, too, but to minimize confusion and errors, I 
suggest using only column vectors). It must have no more than two columns; 
if it has two columns, sound is played in stereo (assuming, of course, 
that your computer has stereo sound playback); otherwise, playback is in 
mono. Finally, the values in <code>Y</code> should range between -1 and 1; values 
with absolute values greater than 1 are "clipped" to their respective 
"max" (for example, a value of -2 is clipped to -1 on playback; +1.2 is 
replaced with +1; etc). While this is not strictly required, I highly 
recommend that you keep this in mind - "clipping" the vector makes 
the sound distorted, which is not good.</p>

<h4 id="Fs"><code>Fs</code></h4>
<p>You usually pass a second value to <code>sound()</code> as well - <code>Fs</code>, or sample 
frequency. It's a good idea to define it, as well; 
otherwise, Matlab plays your sound back at its default sample frequency 
(8192 Hz), which can kind of screw things up if you don't account for it. 
Even if you do use the default rate, I also recommend that you save it into a <em>global constant</em>, since 
you will probably use it in multiple places.</p>

<p><code>Fs</code> should be a 1-by-1 matrix, or a scalar. It does not have to be 
an integer, but it has to be a value supported by your sound hardware. 
I typically use 44100 (44.1 KHz), because it results in good sound quality 
while still being usable on most systems (it's near the upper range of usable 
values on older computers, but pretty moderate on anything produced in 
the last few years) (please email all comments to the effect of "why the heck are 
you using <i>Matlab</i> if you're trying to make high-quality sound?!?" to 
/dev/null).</p>

<h4 id="bits"><code>Bits</code></h4>
<p><code>Sound()</code> can also accept another parameter, <code>bits</code>, the number of bits 
to send to the system sound per sample. <code>Help</code> tells us we 
should use values of 8 or 16 for this; but I'm going to tell you that 24 
and 32 might work too. I'm also going to tell you that you don't really 
need to worry about this one, because I don't.</p>

<h3 id="whatHow">What it does (and how it does it)</h3>
<p>Let's say you've followed my advice so far - you defined a variable 
<code>Fs</code> (and, if you're using it in an m-file, as a global 
variable - remember, Matlab doesn't have constants, so you if you want a 
global constant, you have to define it as a variable, and be careful not 
to overwrite it), and somehow gotten data in the -1-+1 range into a column 
vector <code>y</code>. And now you're wondering, "what do I do?"</p>

<p>Well, by now I really hope you're not. You type in 
"<code>sound(y,Fs);</code>", and hit enter!</p>

<h4 id="whatitdoes">What it does</h4>
<p>Matlab plays the column vector <code>y</code>. As a sound. Which... 
makes sense, right?</p>

<h4 id="howitdoesit">How it does it</h4>
<p>Each value in <code>y</code> corresponds to an amplitude. A value 
of 1.0 represents absolute peak, the "loudest" it can be.</p>
<p><code>Fs</code> tells <code>sound()</code> how often to "play" one of 
these values; it uses the unit Hz (hertz), or inverse-second (1/s). If you 
were to use <code>Fs = 1</code>, then <code>sound()</code> would pass one 
of its entries to the speakers each second. Of course, since the properties of a sound (such as pitch and volume) 
are determined by the amplitude and how the amplitude changes, and the lower limit of human hearing 
is around 30 Hz, sending values of <code>y</code> at 1 Hz would result in, 
at best, a kind of "popping" sound. As a full explanation of the mechanics 
of sound and waves is beyond this example (and possibly my ability to explain, 
given my limited understanding of acoustics), you can safely take my word that you'll 
want a much higher value of <code>Fs</code>.</p>

<p>So, in essence, <code>sound()</code> plays back amplitudes from <code>y</code>, 
at a frequency of <code>Fs</code> - that is, every <code>1/Fs</code> seconds, 
it resets the sound-output-amplitude to the current value of <code>y</code>. 
At a <code>Fs</code> of 44100, this means it's sending 44,100 amplitudes 
every second! <em>That's a lot!!!</em> The good news is, your computer 
should handle it well, and this resetting happens frequently enough that 
you won't notice the "lost" parts in-between (aside - when CD's were new, 
some audiophiles complained about this kind of "digital" sound, as opposed 
to the constant/continuous "analog" sound produced by tapes, records, and 
even radio - but today, nobody really notices the difference). If you'd like to learn more 
about this, some additional helpful terms (for internet-searching purposes) 
include Sampling rate, amplitude, and maybe bitrate and digital audio.</p>

<h4 id="whataboutbits">What about <code>bits</code>?</h4>
<p><code>bits</code> is the third input, the one I haven't told you much about. 
It sets how many bits of data should be sent with each sample. Matlab 
seems to default to 16, and suggests that "most platforms support... 8 and 16" 
You can think of this as a kind of "sample precision" - how many decimal 
places get sent with each sample. Unless this is really important to you 
(which, if you're synthesizing sound with MATLAB, it likely isn't), don't 
worry about it.</p>

<h2 id="quickTry">Quick try-out</h2>
<p>To try this out quickly, run the following code:</p>
<code>
Fs=44100;<br/>
y=rand(3*Fs,1);<br/>
sound(y,Fs);<br/>
</code>
<p>What do you hear? It should be static - high-pitched static. 
For a slightly different example, try using <code>randn()</code> instead 
of <code>rand()</code>; it will sound louder (the normal distribution 
of <code>randn()</code> has more values near or in excess of 1 than 
<code>rand()</code> does) but at a lower/more "centered" pitch (this 
has something to do with the fact that you have both positive and negative 
values in <code>y</code>).</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setting Up the Data</h2>
<p>Making static is... nice? Maybe? I don't think it's all that cool, 
really. What we want, ultimately, is to put together different pitches 
at different lengths of time, to string them together, and to have them 
play back. Right now we have... random numbers, making static.</p>

<p>But like most problems, you can't do it all at once. Let's take it one 
step at a time, and start with making a single pitch</p>

<h3 id="a440">Finding "A 440"</h3>
<p>The more musically inclined in the audience may recognize the term 
"A 440." It is a widely accepted definition for a specific pitch, used for tuning in literally every 
kind of Western or Western-derived music; choral, orchestral, soundtrack, 
blues, rock. Its definition is as follows: "The frequency of the A above 
middle C (C4) is 440 Hz." Since all other pitches have pre-defined relations 
to A (and each other, for that matter), all that is needed to find them 
is to set a single point.</p>

<p>When I first started working on this example, I actually found this 
to be the hardest part. Oh, sure, I could easily generate tones on 
arbitrary frequencies; the problem, I found, was that proper playback 
depended on <code>Fs</code>. If I changed <code>Fs</code>, I'd have to 
change something else, too. But before I go on with that, I need to explain 
a little bit more about sound theory.</p>

<p>By the definitions I will be using here, a "pure tone" is a sine wave 
with a single frequency. This frequency determines the pitch produced by 
the sound wave described by the sine wave; and the volume, loudness, or 
amplitude of that sound wave is also described by the peak altitude of that 
sine wave (which is constant in our definition of "pure tone"). Thus, 
to get a tone pitched at A 440, you need a sine wave with a frequency 
of 440 Hz. To do this, you use an equation like this:</p>
<p id="eq1"><code>
y = A*sin(2*π*440*t);
</code>[Eq. 1]</p>
<p>Where <code>A</code> is peak amplitude (1 or smaller for Matlab), 
<code>π</code> is pi, approximately 3.1416; <code>440</code> is the pitch 
in Hz; and <code>t</code> is time, in seconds.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, this is the most complex equation we will be using. 
Isn't that cool?</p>

<h4 id="playA440">Quick try-out: playing A440</h4>
<p>Before we go on, let's use what we've just learned (for good, never 
evil): let's actually play this note.</p>

<p>Use this code:</p>
<code>
Fs=44100;<br />
t=0:(1/Fs):3;<br />
y=sin(2*pi*440*t);<br />
sound(y,Fs);
</code>

<p>It's just that simple! (Hint: to get it to play longer, replace the 3 
in the second line with another number, the number of seconds you'd like 
it to play).</p>

<p>I have an impulse to explain this all here, but you will just have to 
wait until the proper time and place.</p>

<h3 id="othertones">Finding Other Pitches</h3>
<p>Creating a single tone, a single pitch, is, in my opinion, an order 
of magnitude more cool thand creating white noise. Don't you agree?</p>

<p>But it would be even cooler to make any tone we'd like, wouldn't it?</p>

<h4 id="moretheory">A little more on sound and scale theory</h4>

<p>I have grown up using the Western method of defining pitches, and 
am using it here. Users of other techniques, I am sorry, but I cannot 
help you.</p>
<p>Before I go on, I will define some terms that I intend to use for the 
rest of this section.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pitch: a sound associated with a single, unique frequency (i.e. A 440)</li>
<li>Tone: a set of sounds associated with all octaves of a given pitch (i.e. A, including 440, 220, 110, 880, ...)</li>
<li>Octave: an interval of two pitches wherein the higher-pitched pitch has exactly double the frequency of the lower one</li>
<li>Interval: a combination of two pitches</li>
<li>Chromatic scale: a set of twelve equally-spaced pitches (equally spaced on a logarithmic-base-two scale) between the two pitches in an octave (including the lower pitch, but not the higher one) [I may include, here, a log plot showing the location of different tones in a chromatic scale]</li>
<li>Half-step: the interval between two adjacent pitches on a chromatic scale.</li>
<li>Note: A sound of a specified pitch and duration (this definition is specific to this example; usage in the real world varies).</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me tell you a bit more about octaves. An octave is an interval; and 
an interval is a combination of two notes, or the space between their 
pitches. An octave is a special type of interval - the higher-pitched 
note in an octave has a frequency that is exactly double the frequency 
of the lower pitch. In the letter-assigning system, the pitches are given 
the same letter name as well. For example: we already know that the pitch 
with a frequency of 440 Hz is A; using what we've just learned about 
octaves, we now know taht the pitch with a frequency of 880 Hz is also 
an A, and the one an octave above. We also know that there is another A 
an octave below at 220 Hz.</p>

<p>We also need a technique for getting tones in-between. The Western 
chromatic scale is divided into thirteen pitches, including the top and 
bottom notes of an octave, as well as the eleven pitches in-between. 
Since the top pitch is the octave of the first pitch, they are considered 
the same "tone", and hence the top pitch is not really considered part 
of the chromatic scale. Hence, we have a total of twelve tones.</p>

<p>Now then. Back to the Matlab.</p>

<p>Please note the parenthetical expression in the definition of 
chromatic scale - specifically the "logarithmic-base-two" part. This is 
the key to our ability to find pitches that are not intervals of A 440.</p>

<p>We know that we have a total of twelve pitches above A 440 before we 
"start over" in a different octave; we also know that the highest-pitched 
one of those is A 880, or A with a frequency of 2*440 Hz. The eleven 
intervening are "equally spaced on a logarithmic scale." Thus:</p>

<ul>
<li>The frequency of the A one octave above A 440 is 2<sup>1</sup>*440 Hz = 2<sup>(12/12)</sup>*440 Hz = 880 Hz</li>
<li>The frequency of the other pitches in-between can be determined in a similar manner.</li>
<li>For example: the frequency of A# immediately above A 440 is 2<sup>(1/12)</sup>*440 = 466.1638 Hz</li>
</ul>

<p>So when we define a more general method for determining the frequency 
of a pitch based on its distance from A 440 on a piano keyboard, we get:</p>

<p id="eq2"><code>
freq = 440 * 2 ^ (n/12);
</code>[Eq. 2]</p>

<p>Where <code>freq</code> is the resulting frequency, and <code>n</code> 
is the number of half-steps away from A 440 the desired pitch is (this can 
be positive or negative, or even non-integer, as long as it's a real 
scalar). The derivation of this equation is left as an exercise. Using this, 
we can easily assign an <code>n</code> to all the other pitches we may want:</p>
<center>
<table border="1" id="toneTable">
<tr><th>Pitch</th><th>n</th></tr>
<tr><td>C (high):</td>   <td>+3</td></tr>
<tr><td>B:</td><td>+2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bb:</td><td>+1</td></tr>
<tr><td>A (440):</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ab:</td><td>-1</td></tr>
<tr><td>G:</td><td>-2</td></tr>
<tr><td>F#:</td><td>-3</td></tr>
<tr><td>F:</td><td>-4</td></tr>
<tr><td>E:</td><td>-5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Eb:</td><td>-6</td></tr>
<tr><td>D:</td><td>-7</td></tr>
<tr><td>C#:</td><td>-8</td></tr>
<tr><td>C (middle):</td><td>-9</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<h3 id="time"></h3>

<p>It is also important to make a vector into which you put "time" values 
- that is, how long since starting each sample is. In the 
<a href="#playA440">Playing A440 Example</a> section, I gave you this code: </p>
<code>
t=0:(1/Fs):3;
</code>

<p>and this is similar to the code you will be using:</p>

<code>
t=0:(1/Fs):time;
</code>

<p>In this case, <code>t</code> returns the vector with all of the time 
values; <code>Fs</code> is our global constant sound frequency; and 
<code>time</code> is the duration, in seconds, of the sample that we're 
in the process of creating</p>

<p>And with this, we have all of the pieces that we need.</p>

<h2 id="puttingtogether">Putting Together the Pieces - playing a scale</h2>
<p>[My philosophy on teaching Matlab - and anything else of the nature, 
for that matter - does not involve giving the students the answer. Rather, 
I prefer to walk them through the process of creating the solution themselves. 
Once they're done with that, they should have something similar to the 
example I would have given anyway, and they have been forced to put it 
all together themselves, thereby garnering at least some of the knowledge 
I am hoping to impart].</p>

<p>You will want to put your solution into a function m-file - probably 
a monolithic one, but as I used at least two different functions in mine, 
you could always break them up into separate files.</p>

<p>You'll only need one global variable - the Fs.</p>
<p><i>Aside - I intend to explain global variables earlier in the book, 
and I'll probably do it something like this:</i></p>

<p>To declare a global variable <code>varName</code>, for example, use 
this line in each function you intend to use it in:</p>
<code>global varName</code><br />
<p>Since you should mostly use global variable for constants, you should, 
somewhere near-by, give it a value:</p>
<code>varName = 5.67;</code>
<p>And never use it on the left side of a single equal sign again. 
Remember, you need to declare a global variable in every function that you 
use it in; otherwise, it will be treated as a local variable within that function, 
which can result in your code not working or working incorrectly.</p>

<h3 id="toneFunction">The tone-generating function</h3>
<p>The next thing you should likely do is go directly to the tone-generating 
function. I named mine "tone," though you can name yours whatever you like. 
Mine accepts as inputs a variable "time" (the duration of the tone it is 
to return, in seconds), and "pitch" (the "n" in <a href="#eq1">equation 1</a>). 
It returns the vector <code>Y</code>, as described above. Other things that 
you'll have to do inside this function include generating the vector <code>t</code>, 
which you can do exactly as described in the last section; and defining 
the frequency for use in <a href="#eq1">equation 1</a>, which you can do 
using <a href="#eq2">equation 2</a>.</p>

<h3 id="mainFunction">Back to the main function</h3>
<p>The <a href="#toneFunction">tone-generating function</a> is your basic 
building-block for creating sounds; but the main function (in my case, called 
scale2) is the framework into which those blocks are laid. The overall tasks 
that you wish to accomplish with it include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic set-up (global variables, etc).</li>
<li>Retrieving notes (of specified pitches and durations) from the tone-generating function</li>
<li>See to it that they end up in a single vector</li>
<li>Send this vector (and other appropriate information) to <code>sound()</code></li>
</ul>

<p>There is a lot of latitude for how you implement this, but you must 
tie it in with how you set up the tone-generating function. In my 
implementation, I did the basic set-up first (including, in the comments, 
the <a href="#toneTable">tone table</a>); then, I defined a duration (0.5 seconds) 
that I wanted all of my notes to be. I proceded to store notes in vectors 
with names like "C," "D," "G," and "C2" (for the top octave). I created 8 
of them, ranging from C up to G, then A and B, and finally C2. "C" corresponded 
with "middle C," while "C2" was the one an octave above.</p>

<p>Penultimately, I smashed them all into a single vector. This was done 
in a fairly straightforward way: <code>Y = [C D E ... B C2];</code> Finally, 
I passed <code>Y</code> and <code>Fs</code> to <code>sound()</code>, and 
Matlab did the rest.</p>

<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<p>You may be tempted to do several steps using a for-loop. This is 
totally logical, and makes a lot of sense - you're doing a repetitive 
operation on each element of a vector, incrementing by one each time... 
In practice, however, this doesn't work out as well as you might hope. 
Why is this? Simply put - it's a pretty freakin' huge amount of data, 
and when I tried doing it this way, it took longer for Matlab to do 
all the set-up than it did to listen to the output (and every time I ran 
it, I had to wait the whole time again!)</p>

<p>In order to speed up execution, I have already hinted at the 
kind of things you should do. Namely, you should take advantage of the fact 
that Matlab is designed around working with vectors and matrices. <a href="#eq1">Equation 1</a>, 
for example, can be used as-is (assuming you've appropriately defined the vector <code>t</code> 
beforehand, and eliminated/defined/matlab-friendly-ified all the variables), 
rather than cycling through values in <code>t(ii)</code> and 
assigning the output to values in <code>Y(ii)</code>.</p>

<p>You should address any errors that Matlab throws you the same way 
you always do - check the line numbers, use the help menu, and use Google. Check 
for the stupid mistakes, too (like undefined variables, overwritten variables, or misspellings).</p>

<h2 id="extensions">Extensions</h2>

<p>Hopefully by the time you get this far, you have a working implementation 
that can play a scale. What next?</p>

<p>Try writing a song. Something simple, at first (I coded up "Happy Birthday" 
once). The main difference is that you may have differing durations 
for your notes, and you may require pauses ("rests"). Rests can be added 
by putting in several 0's - it should be simple enough to write a sub-function 
to take care of this.</p>

<p>Try this: modify equation 1 to look like this:</p>
<p id="eq3"><code>Y = sign(sin(2*pi*freq*t));</code></p>
<p>Play your scale, and tell me the difference. Modify your 
function to return the value of <code>Y</code> to a vector, and inspect 
it both with and without this modification; what's the difference?</p>

<p>How about more than one note at once? Chords, even? You can do this 
several ways - one sound for each side in stereo sound, or add them all up 
and divide by 3 (or 4, or 5, or however many notes you have total); or pull 
up the documentation for <code>soundsc();</code> or find some other method 
I haven't thought of.</p>

<p>A most interesting one would be to synthesize the sounds of various 
instruments using harmonic overtones.</p>

<p>Finally, it is possible to export Matlab-created sounds to several sound 
formats (see documentation on <code>wavwrite</code> and <code>auwrite</code>. 
If you put together a really stellar piece using only Matlab, export 
it to a .wav file, email it to me, and I judge it to be truly superior, 
I'll post it on my website and you'll get a prize; also, if you want 
to send your resulting "music" to someone who doesn't have Matlab, this 
would be a good way to do it.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusions</h2>
<p>We have learned a bit about sound, and sound waves. We have learned to 
use Matlab to sythesize and play them, and have an implementation that 
plays a scale. We can, with a little work, use this to play any song 
we choose to put our minds to, and can use it as the basis for several 
other interesting investigations as well.</p>

<p>I hope you learned something, and enjoyed yourself, [<i>and now on to the next chapter?</i>]</p>
